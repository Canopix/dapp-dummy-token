# dApp Dummy Token

### About DUMMY Token
This application interacts with the DUMMY token deployed on Ropsten.
Contract Address here:
https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xCa498a756ea7f05BBa1958542C2CD8B7C99AFcB3

To test this app, you should be on Ropsten Network on Metamask; anyways, the app will show you a Warning about this if you are not on Ropsten. 

### Technical Decisions
In the exercise, redux-sagas was one of those things that should be were nice to have.
I used to work with redux-saga, and it works perfectly, being a modern way to manage the state, fetching external resources, and more.

But I decided no to use it in the development of this app, and there is a special point of why I make this decision: 

- I want to show the team that reviews my code another tool that, IMHO is the easiest way to manage the state, called easy-peasy. This is one idea that I already thought to make an Issue on the Decentraland GitHub repository and suggest it.
